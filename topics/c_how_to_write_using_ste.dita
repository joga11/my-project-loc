            <ul id="ul_bpz_vz1_vpb">
                <li>BASIC RULE: "one word â€“ one meaning." It means the elimination of synonyms,
                    i.e., using only one allowed word for a particular meaning. E.g., using "to
                    fall" we mean "to move down by the force of gravity" and not "to decrease."</li>
                <li>In the case of English dialects, American is preferred.</li>
                <li>Limit to the most precise forms and eliminate forms difficult to
                    understand.</li>
                <li>Split any long clusters of nouns into smaller logical units (no more than three
                    words).</li>
                <li> Use active voice, not passive.</li>
                <li>Express actions with verbs and not by nouns.</li>
                <li>The sentences should not be too long, 20 to 25 words per sentence. Also,
                    sections should not be too long, up to 6 sentences in a section.</li>
                <li>Warnings and caution notes must be properly marked as such. At the very
                    beginning, indicate the actions to be taken. Descriptions of the danger should
                    be placed later.</li>
                <li>Separately indicate advisory notes and explaining details, and they should
                    contain no commands.</li>
            </ul>
